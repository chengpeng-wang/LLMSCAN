# LLMSCAN

LLMSCAN is a tool designed to parse and analyze source code to instantiate LLM-based program analysis. Based on Tree-sitter, it provides functionality to identify and extract functions from the source code, along with their metadata such as function name, line numbers, parameters, call sites, and other program constructs (including branches and loops). Importantly, it achieves light-weighted call graph analysis based on parsing, which enables more effective code browsing and navigation for real-world programs. The latest version of LLMSCAN can support four programming languages, including C, C++, Java, and Python.

**Attention**: Considering the language syntax differences, we give up supporting multiple languages in main branch. Since 2024/11/23, the active development branches have been cpp, java, and python.


## Features

- Parse source code using Tree-sitter.
- Browse code for prompting-based static analysis.
- Multi-linguistic support.

## Functionalities

- APIScan: Search all the call sites of specific APIs
- MetaScan: Extract syntactic facts as function metadata.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:PurCL/LLMSCAN.git
    cd LLMSCAN
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure you have the Tree-sitter library and language bindings installed:
    ```sh
    cd lib
    python build.py
    ```

4. Configure the keys:
    ```sh
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxkey1:sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxkey2:sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxkey3:sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxkey4 >> ~/.bashrc
    ```
    We suggest including multiple keys to facilitate parallel analysis with high throughput.

    Similarly, the other two keys can be set as follows:
    ```sh
    export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=xxxxxx >> ~/.bashrc
    export GEMINI_KEY=xxxxxx >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

## Quick Start

1. Prepare the project that you want to analyze. Here we use the Linux kernel as an example:
    ```sh
    cd benchmark
    mkdir C && cd C
    git clone git@github.com:torvalds/linux.git
    ```

2. Run the analysis to detect the misuse of `mhi_alloc_controller`:
    ```sh
    cd src
    ./run.sh
    ```

The output files are dumped in the directory `log`, including the bug reports (in `detect_result.json`) and analyzed functions (in `probe_scope.json`).

## How to Extend

### More Program Facts

You can implement your own analysis by adding more modules, such as more parsing-based primitives (in `parser/program_parser`). If you want to derive semantic facts, which may be beyond the capability of parsing-based analysis, you can customize the prompts (in `prompt/apiscan_prompt.py` or other user-defined prompt files) and leverage LLMs to derive them in a neural manner.

### More Bug Types

As a simple demo, we only concentrate on API misuse detection and show three misuse patterns in `prompt/apiscan_prompt.py`. In particular, we only analyze the misuse of `mhi_alloc_controller`. You can comment or delete the following code snippet in `pipeline/apiscan.py` to analyze the other two API misuses:
```python
if sensitive_function != "mhi_alloc_controller":
    continue
```

### More Programming Languages

The framework is language-agnostic. To migrate the current implementations to other programming languages or extract more syntactic facts, please refer to the grammar files in the corresponding Tree-sitter libraries and refactor the code in `parser/program_parser.py`. Basically, you only need to change the node types when invoking `find_nodes_by_type`.
